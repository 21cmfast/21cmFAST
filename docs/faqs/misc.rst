My run seg-faulted, what should I do?
=====================================
Since ``21cmFAST`` is written in C, there is the off-chance that something
catastrophic will happen, causing a segfault. Typically, if this happens, Python will
not print a traceback where the error occurred, and finding the source of such errors
can be difficult. However, one has the option of using the standard library
`faulthandler <https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html>`_. Specifying
``-X faulthandler`` when invoking Python will cause a minimal traceback to be printed
to ``stderr`` if a segfault occurs.
