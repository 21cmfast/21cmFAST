        **A semi-numerical cosmological simulation code for the radio 21cm signal.**
        
        This is the official repository for 21cmFAST. As of `v3.0.0`, it is conveniently
        wrapped in Python to enable more dynamic code.
        
        This code uses `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_, though this will strictly
        begin when `v3.0.0` is officially shipped.
        
        
        
        New Features in 3.0.0+
        ======================
        
        * Robust on-disk caching/writing both for efficiency and simplified reading of
          previously processed data (using HDF5).
        * Convenient data objects which simplify access to and processing of the various density
          and ionization fields.
        * De-coupled functions mean that arbitrary functionality can be injected into the process.
        * Improved exception handling and debugging

        Changelog
        =========
        
        v3.0.0rc1
        ---------
        
        
        v2.0.0
        ------
        All changes and equations for this version are found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08995.
        
        Changed
        ~~~~~~~
        
        * Updated the ionizing source model: (i) the star formation rates and ionizing escape
          fraction are scaled with the masses of dark matter halos and (ii) the abundance of
          active star forming galaxies is exponentially suppressed below the turn-over halo
          mass, M_{turn}, according to a duty cycle of exp(âˆ’M_{turn}/M_{h}), where M_{h} is a
          halo mass.
        * Removed the mean free path parameter, R_{mfp}. Instead, directly computes
          inhomogeneous, sub-grid recombinations in the intergalactic medium following the
          approach of Sobacchi & Mesinger (2014)
        
        
        
        
        v1.2.0
        ------
        Added
        ~~~~~
        * Support for a halo mass dependent ionizing efficiency: zeta = zeta_0 (M/Mmin)^alpha,
          where zeta_0 corresponds to  HII_EFF_FACTOR, Mmin --> ION_M_MIN,
          alpha --> EFF_FACTOR_PL_INDEX in ANAL_PARAMS.H
        
        
        v1.12.0
        -------
        Added
        ~~~~~
        - Code 'redshift_interpolate_boxes.c' to interpolate between comoving cubes,
          creating comoving light cone boxes.
        - Enabled openMP threading  for SMP machines.  You can specify the number of threads
          (for best performace, do not exceed the number of processors) in INIT_PARAMS.H. You do
          not need to have an SMP machine to run the code. NOTE: YOU SHOULD RE-INSTALL FFTW to
          use openMP (see INSTALL file)
        - Included a threaded driver file 'drive_zscroll_reion_param.c' set-up to perform
          astrophysical parameter studies of reionization
        - Included explicit support for WDM cosmologies; see COSMOLOGY.H.  The prescription is
          similar to that discussed in Barkana+2001; Mesinger+2005, madifying the (i) transfer
          function (according to the Bode+2001 formula; and (ii) including the effective
          pressure term of WDM using a Jeans mass analogy.  (ii) is approximated with a sharp
          cuttoff in the EPS barrier, using 60* M_J found in Barkana+2001 (the 60 is an
          adjustment factor found by fitting to the WDM collapsed fraction).
        - A Gaussian filtering step of the PT fields to perturb_field.c, in addition to the
          implicit boxcar smoothing.  This avoids having"empty" density cells, i.e. \delta=-1,
          with some small loss in resolution.  Although for most uses \delta=-1 is ok, some Lya
          forest statistics do not like it.
        - Added treatment of the risidual electron fraction from X-ray heating when computing
          the ionization field.  Relatedly, modified Ts.c to output all intermediate evolution
          boxes, Tk and x_e.
        - Added a missing factor of Omega_b in Ts.c corresponding to eq. 18 in MFC11.  Users who
          used a previous version should note that their results just effecively correspond to a
          higher effective X-ray efficiency, scaled by 1/Omega_baryon.
        - Normalization optimization to Ts.c, increasing performace on arge resolution boxes
        
        
        Fixed
        ~~~~~
        - GSL interpolation error in kappa_elec_pH for GSL versions > 1.15
        - Typo in macro definition, which impacted the Lya background calculation in v1.11 (not applicable to earlier releases)
        - Outdated filename sytax when calling gen_size_distr in drive_xHIscroll
        - Redshift scrolling so that drive_logZscroll_Ts.c and Ts.c are in sync.
        
        Changed
        ~~~~~~~
        - Output format to avoid FFT padding for all boxes
        - Filename conventions to be more explicit.
        - Small changes to organization and structure
        
        
        v1.1.0
        ------
        Added
        ~~~~~
        - Wrapper functions mod_fwrite() and mod_fread() in Cosmo_c_progs/misc.c, which
          should fix problems with the library fwrite() and fread() for large files (>4GB) on
          certain operating systems.
        - Included print_power_spectrum_ICs.c program which reads in high resolution initial
          conditions and prints out an ASCII file with the associated power spectrum.
        - Parameter in Ts.c for the maximum allowed kinetic temperature, which increases
          stability of the code when the redshift step size and the X-ray efficiencies are large.
        
        Fixed
        ~~~~~
        - Oversight adding support for a Gaussian filter for the lower resolution field.
