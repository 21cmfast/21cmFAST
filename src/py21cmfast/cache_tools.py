    """
    A function to read in a data set and return an appropriate object for it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    direc : str, optional
            The directory in which to search for the boxes. By default, this is the
            centrally-managed directory, given by the ``config.yml`` in ``~/.21cmfast/``.
    fname: str, optional
        The filename (without directory) of the data set. If given, this will be
        preferentially used, and must exist.
    hash: str, optional
        The md5 hash of the object desired to be read. Required if `fname` not given.
    kind: str, optional
        The kind of dataset, eg. "InitialConditions". Will be the name of a class
        defined in :mod:`~wrapper`. Required if `fname` not given.
    seed: str or int, optional
        The random seed of the data set to be read. If not given, and filename not
        given, then a box will be read if it matches the kind and hash, with an
        arbitrary seed.
    load_data: bool, optional
        Whether to read in the data in the data set. Otherwise, only its defining
        parameters are read.

    Returns
    -------
    dataset:
        An output object, whose type depends on the kind of data set being read.
