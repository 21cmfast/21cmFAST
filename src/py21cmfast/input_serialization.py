    While the :class:`~py21cmfast.wrapper.inputs.InputParameters.asdict` method allows
    several options for "unstructuring" the inputs to a dictionary, this function is
    much more flexible, having options that cover a number of use-cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs
        The input parameters to convert to a dict.
    mode
        Either 'minimal' to get the minimal dictionary required to specify the
        parameters (on top of defaults) or 'full' to keep all parameters.
    only_structs
        Whether to only return InputStruct objects (unstructured to dicts),
        otherwise also return other attributes (e.g. random_seed).
    camel
        Whether the keys of the returned dict should be camel-case, e.g.
        SimulationOptions. Otherwise, return as snake_case. Only applies to
        InputStruct attributes of the inputs (i.e. not node_redshifts or random_seed).
    only_cstruct_params
        Only return parameters that are part of the Cstruct, rather than all
        fields of the class. This is useful for pretty-printing.
    use_aliases
        If True, use correct aliases for parameters, which allows the dictionary
        to be passed back into the InputStruct constructors (e.g. use DIM instead
        of _DIM).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dict_of_structdicts
        A dictionary whose keys are names of InputStruct attributes of
