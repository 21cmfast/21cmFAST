This is the official repository for ``21cmFAST``: a semi-numerical code that is able to
produce 3D cosmological realisations of many physical fields in the early Universe.
It is super-fast, combining the excursion set formalism with perturbation theory to
efficiently generate density, velocity, halo, ionization, spin temperature, 21-cm, and
even ionizing flux fields (see the above lightcones!).
It has been tested extensively against numerical simulations, with excellent agreement
at the relevant scales.

``21cmFAST`` has been widely used, for example, by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA),
LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), to model the
large-scale cosmological 21-cm signal. In particular, the speed of ``21cmFAST`` is important
to produce simulations that are large enough (several Gpc across) to represent modern
low-frequency observations.

Documentation
=============
Full documentation (with examples, installation instructions and full API reference)
found at https://21cmfast.readthedocs.org.

New Features in 4.0.0
=====================

* A discrete halo sampler allowing for the creation of lightcones of galaxy properties and the
  inclusion of stochasticity. These discrete sources are self-consistently used in the IGM calculations
* The Inclusion of the Sheth-Tormen conditional halo mass function.
* Re-designed input/output structures which prioritise transparency.
* Refactoring of several of the C backend files for much easier development.
* A lower-level testing framework for calculations done in the backend.

As of ``v3.0.0``, ``21cmFAST`` is conveniently wrapped in Python to enable more dynamic code.


New Features in 3.0.0+
======================

* Robust on-disk caching/writing both for efficiency and simplified reading of
  previously processed data (using HDF5).
* Convenient data objects which simplify access to and processing of the various density
  and ionization fields.
* De-coupled functions mean that arbitrary functionality can be injected into the process.
* Improved exception handling and debugging
* Comprehensive documentation
* Comprehensive test suite.
* Strict `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_.


Installation
============
We support Linux and MacOS (please let us know if you are successful in installing on
Windows!). On these systems, the simplest way to get ``21cmFAST`` is by using
`conda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_::

    conda install -c conda-forge 21cmFAST

``21cmFAST`` is also available on PyPI, so that ``pip install 21cmFAST`` also works. However,
it depends on some external (non-python) libraries that may not be present, and so this
method is discouraged unless absolutely necessary. If using ``pip`` to install ``21cmFAST``
(especially on MacOS), we thoroughly recommend reading the detailed
`installation instructions <https://21cmfast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.

If you are unsure which modules are used within your simulations, we provide a handy function
to print out which works to refer ``py21cmfast.utils.show_references``, which accepts a single instance of
the ``InputParameters`` class and shows which papers are relevant for your simulation.
